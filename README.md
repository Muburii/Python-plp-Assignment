 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker 

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of global COVID-19 data. The goal is to explore trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations across selected countries using real-world data.

  Objectives

- Clean and prepare COVID-19 data for analysis.
- Perform time-series analysis on total cases and deaths.
- Analyze and compare vaccination progress by country.
- Calculate and visualize critical indicators such as death rates.
- Generate insights and visual narratives from the data.

  Tools & Libraries Used

-  Python 3
-  pandas – data manipulation
-  matplotlib – basic plotting
-  seaborn – advanced statistical visualizations
-  Google Colab 

   How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Ensure the dataset file (`synth/ Jupyter Notebooketic_covid19_data.csv`) is in your Google Drive.
3. Run each cell in order:
   - Load the data
   - Clean and preprocess
   - Perform analysis
   - View visualizations and summaries

  Insights & Reflections

- The USA consistently had the highest number of reported total cases.
- Death rates varied significantly; Brazil showed higher fatality proportions.
- Vaccination coverage was highest in the UK, with India showing strong improvement post-2021.
- Visualization helped uncover time-based trends and health disparities between countries.
- The project reinforced the importance of data quality and consistent reporting in health data analysis.
